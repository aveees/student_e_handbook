It was initially organized when civic-minded citizens, headed by the late General Alejo Santos, established the Bustos Vocational and Technical School in November 1975.
\n\nIt began to operate as an obscure non-formal training school, offering short-term courses, temporarily housed at Bustos Central School. After six months of existence, it was transferred to the present site and address at Poblacion, Bustos, Bulacan. The Voc-Tech school, including its land, buildings, and equipment, was donated to BulSU by the municipality of Bustos, Bulacan on May 12, 1976, by virtue of BCAT Board Resolution No. 400."

\n\nIn 1977, Mr. Venancio Magdirila became in-charge of the Bustos Branch and was responsible for the expansion of program offerings to include secondary education. It was in his term when initial plans to offer teacher education were conceived, but these were not realized because of the acute shortage of facilities and faculty.
\n\nIn June 1979, Mr. Aurelio F. Dionisio was designated in-charge of BCAT Bustos. Through his able leadership, Bustos Campus was able to pursue wide-ranging physical plan development and add more courses to the technical education offerings. The campus served as the hub for trade and industrial training in Bustos and its neighboring municipalities, which included the nearby towns of Pampanga."

He launched innovative plans for reengineering the goals and objectives of the campus. One of his major accomplishments was the launching of programs that built efficient citizen workers, offering terminal courses in Automotive Technology, Radio Mechanics, Cosmetology, Garments Trade, Drafting, and Food Technology. Massive faculty development programs were also launched, including in-service training to expose the faculty to the realm of the college setting."

She also planned the establishment of a food-processing center, which would strengthen the university’s connection to neighboring towns and industries. Lastly, she envisioned a review center for teacher education to help graduates prepare for their licensure examinations.
\n\nDr. Ladislao D. Marcelo replaced Prof. Cinco when she was transferred to the main campus to share her expertise in managing the BulSU Hostel. Dr. Marcelo brought with him his vast experience as an AACCUP Accreditator, successfully leading the campus to pass the AACCUP Level I Accreditation in March 2007.
